			<h1 class="chapter">1 Overview</h1>


<p>This manual is a detailed description of the MIT/GNU Scheme runtime system. 
It is intended to be a reference document for programmers.  It does not
describe how to run Scheme or how to interact with it &mdash; that is the
subject of the MIT/GNU Scheme User's Manual. </p>

   <p>This chapter summarizes the semantics of Scheme, briefly describes the
MIT/GNU Scheme programming environment, and explains the syntactic and
lexical conventions of the language.  Subsequent chapters describe
special forms, numerous data abstractions, and facilities for input and
output.

   <p>Throughout this manual, we will make frequent references to
standard Scheme, which is the language defined by the document
Revised^4 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme, by William
Clinger, Jonathan Rees, et al., or by ieee Std. 1178-1990,
IEEE Standard for the Scheme Programming Language (in fact,
several parts of this document are copied from the Revised
Report).  MIT/GNU Scheme is an extension of standard Scheme.

   <p>These are the significant semantic characteristics of the Scheme
language:

     <dl>
<dt>Variables are statically scoped<dd>Scheme is a statically scoped programming language, which means that
each use of a variable is associated with a lexically apparent binding
of that variable.  Algol is another statically scoped language.

     <dt>Types are latent<dd>Scheme has latent types as opposed to manifest types, which
means that Scheme associates types with values (or objects) rather than
with variables.  Other languages with latent types (also referred to as
weakly typed or dynamically typed languages) include APL,
Snobol, and other dialects of Lisp.  Languages with manifest types
(sometimes referred to as strongly typed or statically typed
languages) include Algol 60, Pascal, and C.

     <br><dt>Objects have unlimited extent<dd>All objects created during a Scheme computation, including procedures
and continuations, have unlimited extent; no Scheme object is ever
destroyed.  The system doesn't run out of memory because the garbage
collector reclaims the storage occupied by an object when the object
cannot possibly be needed by a future computation.  Other languages in
which most objects have unlimited extent include APL and other Lisp
dialects.

     <br><dt>Proper tail recursion<dd>Scheme is <dfn>properly tail-recursive</dfn>, which means that iterative
computation can occur in constant space, even if the iterative
computation is described by a syntactically recursive /.  With a
tail-recursive implementation, you can express iteration using the
ordinary procedure-call mechanics; special iteration expressions are
provided only for syntactic convenience.

     <br><dt>Procedures are objects<dd>Scheme procedures are objects, which means that you can create them
dynamically, store them in data structures, return them as the results
of other procedures, and so on.  Other languages with such procedure
objects include Common Lisp and ML.

     <br><dt>Continuations are explicit<dd>In most other languages, continuations operate behind the scenes.  In
Scheme, continuations are objects; you can use continuations for
implementing a variety of advanced control constructs, including
non-local exits, backtracking, and coroutines.

     <br><dt>Arguments are passed by value<dd>Arguments to Scheme procedures are passed by value, which means that
Scheme evaluates the argument expressions before the procedure gains
control, whether or not the procedure needs the result of the
evaluations.  ML, C, and APL are three other languages that pass
arguments by value.  In languages such as SASL and Algol 60, argument
expressions are not evaluated unless the values are needed by the
procedure. 
</dl>

   <p>Scheme uses a parenthesized-list Polish notation to describe programs
and (other) data.  The syntax of Scheme, like that of most Lisp
dialects, provides for great expressive power, largely due to its
simplicity.  An important consequence of this simplicity is the
susceptibility of Scheme programs and data to uniform treatment by other
Scheme programs.  As with other Lisp dialects, the <code>read</code> primitive
parses its input; that is, it performs syntactic as well as lexical
decomposition of what it reads.

<p>
This section details the notational conventions used throughout the rest
of this document.</p>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.1 Errors</h4>

<p>
When this manual uses the phrase &ldquo;an error will be signalled,&rdquo; it
means that Scheme will call <code>error</code>, which normally halts execution
of the program and prints an error message.</p>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.2 Examples</h4>

<p>This manual gives many examples showing the evaluation of expressions. 
The examples have a common format that shows the expression being
evaluated on the left hand side, an &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; in the middle, and the
value of the expression written on the right.  For example:

<pre class="example">     (+ 1 2)          =&gt;  3
</pre>
   <p>Sometimes the arrow and value will be moved under the expression, due to
lack of space.  Occasionally we will not care what the value is, in
which case both the arrow and the value are omitted.

   <p>If an example shows an evaluation that results in an error, an error
message is shown, prefaced by `<samp><span class="samp">error--&gt;</span></samp>':

<pre class="example">     (+ 1 'foo)                      error--&gt; Illegal datum
</pre>
   <p>An example that shows printed output marks it with `<samp><span class="samp">-|</span></samp>':

<pre class="example">     (begin (write 'foo) 'bar)
          -| foo
          =&gt; bar
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">1.1.3 Entry Format</h4>

<p>name="index-entry-format-37"
Each description of an MIT/GNU Scheme variable, special form, or
procedure begins with one or more header lines in this format:

<p>category: template</p>


<p class="noindent">where <var>category</var> specifies the kind of item (&ldquo;variable&rdquo;,
&ldquo;special form&rdquo;, or &ldquo;procedure&rdquo;).  The form of <var>template</var> is
interpreted depending on <var>category</var>.

     <dl>
<dt>Variable<dd><var>Template</var> consists of the variable's name. 

<br><dt>Special Form<dd><var>Template</var> starts with the syntactic keyword of the special form,
followed by a description of the special form's syntax.  The description
is written using the following conventions. 

Named components are italicized in the printed manual, and uppercase in
the Info file.  &ldquo;Noise&rdquo; keywords, such as the <code>else</code> keyword in
the <code>cond</code> special form, are set in a fixed width font in the
printed manual; in the Info file they are not distinguished. 
Parentheses indicate themselves.

     <p>A horizontal ellipsis (<small class="dots">...</small>) is describes repeated components. 
Specifically,

     <pre class="display">          <var>thing</var> <small class="dots">...</small>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">indicates <em>zero</em> or more occurrences of <var>thing</var>, while

     <pre class="display">          <var>thing</var> <var>thing</var> <small class="dots">...</small>
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">indicates <em>one</em> or more occurrences of <var>thing</var>.

     <p>Brackets, <code>[ ]</code>, enclose optional components.

     <p>Several special forms (e.g. <code>lambda</code>) have an internal component
consisting of a series of expressions; usually these expressions are
evaluated sequentially under conditions that are specified in the
description of the special form.  This sequence of expressions is commonly
referred to as the <dfn>body</dfn> of the special form.

     <br><dt>Procedure<dd><var>Template</var> starts with the name of the variable to which the
procedure is bound, followed by a description of the procedure's
arguments.  The arguments are described using &ldquo;lambda list&rdquo; notation, except that brackets are used to denote
optional arguments, and ellipses are used to denote &ldquo;rest&rdquo; arguments. 
The names of the procedure's arguments are italicized in the printed
manual, and uppercase in the Info file.

     <p>When an argument names a Scheme data type, it indicates that the
argument must be that type of data object.  For example,

     <div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>cdr</b><var> pair</var><br>
</div>

     <p class="noindent">indicates that the standard Scheme procedure <code>cdr</code> takes one argument,
which must be a pair.

     <p>Many procedures signal an error when an argument is of the wrong type;
usually this error is a condition of type
<code>condition-type:wrong-type-argument</code>. 
<a name="index-condition_002dtype_003awrong_002dtype_002dargument-54"></a>
In addition to the standard data-type names (<var>pair</var>, <var>list</var>,
<var>boolean</var>, <var>string</var>, etc.), the following names as arguments
also imply type restrictions:

          <dl>
<dt>object: any object</dt>
<dt>thunk: a procedure of no arguments</dt>
<dt>x, <var>y</var>: real numbers</dt>
<dt>q, <var>n</var>: integers</dt>
<dt>k: an exact non-negative integer</dt>
     </dl>

   <p>Some examples:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>list</b><var> object <small class="dots">...</small></var><br>
</div>

<p class="noindent">indicates that the standard Scheme procedure <code>list</code> takes zero or
more arguments, each of which may be any Scheme object.</p>

 <p>When this manual indicates that the value returned by some expression is
<dfn>unspecified</dfn>, it means that the expression will evaluate to some
object without signalling an error, but that programs should not depend
on the value in any way.</p>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; procedure: <b>write-char</b><var> char </var>[<var>output-port</var>]<var></var><br>
</div>

<p class="noindent">indicates that the standard Scheme procedure <code>write-char</code> must be
called with a character, <var>char</var>, and may also be called with a
character and an output port.</p>
</dd></dd></dl>

<h1>1.2 Scheme Concepts</h1>



<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Variable Bindings</h4>

<p>
Any identifier that is not a syntactic keyword may be used as a variable.  A variable may name a location where a value can
be stored.  A variable that does so is said to be <dfn>bound</dfn> to the
location.  The value stored in the location to which a variable is bound
is called the variable's <dfn>value</dfn>.  (The variable is sometimes said
to <dfn>name</dfn> the value or to be <dfn>bound to</dfn> the value.)

   <p>A variable may be bound but still not have a value; such a variable is
said to be <dfn>unassigned</dfn>.  Referencing an unassigned variable is an
error.  When this error is signalled, it is a condition of type
<code>condition-type:unassigned-variable</code>; sometimes the compiler does
not generate code to signal the error.  Unassigned variables are useful
only in combination with side effects (see <a href="Assignments.html#Assignments">Assignments</a>). 


<h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 Environment Concepts</h4>

<p><a name="index-environment-_0028defn_0029-67"></a><a name="index-unbound-variable-_0028defn_0029-68"></a><a name="index-error_002c-unbound-variable-_0028defn_0029-69"></a>An <dfn>environment</dfn> is a set of variable bindings.  If an environment
has no binding for a variable, that variable is said to be <dfn>unbound</dfn>
in that environment.  Referencing an unbound variable signals a
condition of type <code>condition-type:unbound-variable</code>. 
<a name="index-condition_002dtype_003aunbound_002dvariable-70"></a>
<a name="index-extension_002c-of-environment-_0028defn_0029-71"></a><a name="index-environment_002c-extension-_0028defn_0029-72"></a><a name="index-shadowing_002c-of-variable-binding-_0028defn_0029-73"></a><a name="index-parent_002c-of-environment-_0028defn_0029-74"></a><a name="index-child_002c-of-environment-_0028defn_0029-75"></a><a name="index-inheritance_002c-of-environment-bindings-_0028defn_0029-76"></a>A new environment can be created by <dfn>extending</dfn> an existing
environment with a set of new bindings.  Note that &ldquo;extending an
environment&rdquo; does <strong>not</strong> modify the environment; rather, it
creates a new environment that contains the new bindings and the old
ones.  The new bindings <dfn>shadow</dfn> the old ones; that is, if an
environment that contains a binding for <code>x</code> is extended with a new
binding for <code>x</code>, then only the new binding is seen when <code>x</code> is
looked up in the extended environment.  Sometimes we say that the
original environment is the <dfn>parent</dfn> of the new one, or that the new
environment is a <dfn>child</dfn> of the old one, or that the new environment
<dfn>inherits</dfn> the bindings in the old one.

   <p><a name="index-let-77"></a><a name="index-let_002a-78"></a><a name="index-letrec-79"></a><a name="index-do-80"></a><a name="index-define-81"></a>Procedure calls extend an environment, as do <code>let</code>, <code>let*</code>,
<code>letrec</code>, and <code>do</code> expressions.  Internal definitions
(see <a href="Internal-Definitions.html#Internal-Definitions">Internal Definitions</a>) also extend an environment.  (Actually,
all the constructs that extend environments can be expressed in terms of
procedure calls, so there is really just one fundamental mechanism for
environment extension.)  A top-level definition (see <a href="Top_002dLevel-Definitions.html#Top_002dLevel-Definitions">Top-Level Definitions</a>) may add a binding to an existing environment.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.4 Static Scoping</h4>

<p><a name="index-scoping_002c-static-90"></a><a name="index-static-scoping-91"></a>
<a name="index-dynamic-binding_002c-versus-static-scoping-92"></a>Scheme is a statically scoped language with block structure.  In this
respect, it is like Algol and Pascal, and unlike most other dialects of
Lisp except for Common Lisp.

   <p><a name="index-binding-expression-_0028defn_0029-93"></a><a name="index-expression_002c-binding-_0028defn_0029-94"></a>The fact that Scheme is statically scoped (rather than
dynamically bound) means that the environment that is extended (and
becomes current) when a procedure is called is the environment in which
the procedure was created (i.e. in which the procedure's defining
lambda expression was evaluated), not the environment in which the
procedure is called.  Because all the other Scheme <dfn>binding
expressions</dfn> can be expressed in terms of procedures, this determines
how all bindings behave.

   <p>Consider the following definitions, made at the top-level <acronym>REP</acronym>
loop (in the initial environment):

<pre class="example">     (define x 1)
     (define (f x) (g 2))
     (define (g y) (+ x y))
     (f 5)                                       =&gt;  3 <span class="roman">; not</span> 7
</pre>
   <p>Here <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are bound to procedures created in the
initial environment.  Because Scheme is statically scoped, the call to
<code>g</code> from <code>f</code> extends the initial environment (the one in which
<code>g</code> was created) with a binding of <code>y</code> to <code>2</code>.  In this
extended environment, <code>y</code> is <code>2</code> and <code>x</code> is <code>1</code>. 
(In a dynamically bound Lisp, the call to <code>g</code> would extend the
environment in effect during the call to <code>f</code>, in which <code>x</code> is
bound to <code>5</code> by the call to <code>f</code>, and the answer would be
<code>7</code>.)

   <p><a name="index-lexical-scoping-_0028defn_0029-95"></a><a name="index-scoping_002c-lexical-_0028defn_0029-96"></a><a name="index-region_002c-of-variable-binding-_0028defn_0029-97"></a><a name="index-variable_002c-binding-region-_0028defn_0029-98"></a><a name="index-lambda-99"></a>Note that with static scoping, you can tell what binding a variable
reference refers to just from looking at the text of the program; the
referenced binding cannot depend on how the program is used.  That is,
the nesting of environments (their parent-child relationship)
corresponds to the nesting of binding expressions in program text. 
(Because of this connection to the text of the program, static scoping
is also called <dfn>lexical</dfn> scoping.)  For each place where a variable
is bound in a program there is a corresponding <dfn>region</dfn> of the
program text within which the binding is effective.  For example, the
region of a binding established by a <code>lambda</code> expression is the
entire body of the <code>lambda</code> expression.  The documentation of each
binding expression explains what the region of the bindings it makes is. 
A use of a variable (that is, a reference to or assignment of a
variable) refers to the innermost binding of that variable whose region
contains the variable use.  If there is no such region, the use refers
to the binding of the variable in the global environment (which is an
ancestor of all other environments, and can be thought of as a region in
which all your programs are contained).</p>


<h4>1.2.5 True and False</h4>

<p>In Scheme, the boolean values true and false are denoted by <code>#t</code>
and <code>#f</code>.  However, any Scheme value can be treated as a boolean
for the purpose of a conditional test.  This manual uses the word
<dfn>true</dfn> to refer to any Scheme value that counts as true, and the
word <dfn>false</dfn> to refer to any Scheme value that counts as false.  In
conditional tests, all values count as true except for <code>#f</code>, which
counts as false (see <a href="Conditionals.html#Conditionals">Conditionals</a>.)</p>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.6 External Representations</h4>

<p><a name="index-external-representation-_0028defn_0029-105"></a><a name="index-representation_002c-external-_0028defn_0029-106"></a>An important concept in Scheme is that of the
<dfn>external representation</dfn> of an object as a sequence of characters. 
For example, an external representation of the integer 28 is the
sequence of characters `<samp><span class="samp">28</span></samp>', and an external representation of a
list consisting of the integers 8 and 13 is the sequence of characters
`<samp><span class="samp">(8 13)</span></samp>'.

   <p>The external representation of an object is not necessarily unique.  The
integer 28 also has representations `<samp><span class="samp">#e28.000</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">#x1c</span></samp>', and
the list in the previous paragraph also has the representations `<samp><span class="samp">(
08 13 )</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">(8 . (13 . ( )))</span></samp>'.

   <p>Many objects have standard external representations, but some, such as
procedures and circular data structures, do not have standard
representations (although particular implementations may define
representations for them).

   <p>An external representation may be written in a program to obtain the
corresponding object (see <a href="Quoting.html#Quoting">Quoting</a>).

   <p><a name="index-read-107"></a><a name="index-write-108"></a>External representations can also be used for input and output.  The
procedure <code>read</code> parses external representations, and the procedure
<code>write</code> generates them.  Together, they provide an elegant and
powerful input/output facility.

   <p>Note that the sequence of characters `<samp><span class="samp">(+ 2 6)</span></samp>' is <em>not</em> an
external representation of the integer 8, even though it <em>is</em> an
expression that evaluates to the integer 8; rather, it is an external
representation of a three-element list, the elements of which are the
symbol <code>+</code> and the integers <code>2</code> and <code>6</code>.  Scheme's syntax
has the property that any sequence of characters that is an expression
is also the external representation of some object.  This can lead to
confusion, since it may not be obvious out of context whether a given
sequence of characters is intended to denote data or program, but it is
also a source of power, since it facilitates writing programs such as
interpreters and compilers that treat programs as data or data as
programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.7 Disjointness of Types</h4>

<p>Every object satisfies at most one of the following predicates (but see
<a href="True-and-False.html#True-and-False">True and False</a>, for an exception):</p>

<pre class="example">     bit-string?     environment?    port?           symbol?
     boolean?        null?           procedure?      vector?
     cell?           number?         promise?        weak-pair?
     char?           pair?           string?
     condition?
</pre>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.8 Storage Model</h4>

<p>This section describes a model that can be used to understand Scheme's
use of storage.

   <p><a name="index-location-109"></a><a name="index-string_002dset_0021-110"></a>Variables and objects such as pairs, vectors, and strings implicitly
denote locations or sequences of locations.  A string, for example,
denotes as many locations as there are characters in the string.  (These
locations need not correspond to a full machine word.)  A new value may
be stored into one of these locations using the <code>string-set!</code>
procedure, but the string continues to denote the same locations as
before.

   <p><a name="index-car-111"></a><a name="index-vector_002dref-112"></a><a name="index-string_002dref-113"></a><a name="index-eqv_003f-114"></a>An object fetched from a location, by a variable reference or by a
procedure such as <code>car</code>, <code>vector-ref</code>, or <code>string-ref</code>,
is equivalent in the sense of <code>eqv?</code> to the object last stored in
the location before the fetch.

   <p>Every location is marked to show whether it is in use.  No variable or
object ever refers to a location that is not in use.  Whenever this
document speaks of storage being allocated for a variable or object,
what is meant is that an appropriate number of locations are chosen from
the set of locations that are not in use, and the chosen locations are
marked to indicate that they are now in use before the variable or
object is made to denote them.

   <p><a name="index-constant-115"></a><a name="index-mutable-116"></a><a name="index-immutable-117"></a><a name="index-symbol_002d_003estring-118"></a>In many systems it is desirable for constants (i.e. the values of
literal expressions) to reside in read-only memory.  To express this, it
is convenient to imagine that every object that denotes locations is
associated with a flag telling whether that object is mutable or
immutable.  The constants and the strings returned by
<code>symbol-&gt;string</code> are then the immutable objects, while all objects
created by other procedures are mutable.  It is an error to attempt to
store a new value into a location that is denoted by an immutable
object.  Note that the MIT/GNU Scheme compiler takes advantage of this
property to share constants, but that these constants are not immutable. 
Instead, two constants that are <code>equal?</code> may be <code>eq?</code> in
compiled code.</p>

<h1>1.3 Lexical Conventions</h1>
<h4 class="subsection">1.3.1 Whitespace</h4>
<p>Whitespace characters are spaces, newlines, tabs, and page breaks. Whitespace is used to improve the readability of your programs and to separate tokens from each other, when necessary. (A token is an indivisible lexical unit such as an identifier or number.) Whitespace is otherwise insignificant. Whitespace may occur between any two tokens, but not within a token. Whitespace may also occur inside a string, where it is significant.</p>
<h1>1.3.2 Delimiters</h1>
<p>All whitespace characters are delimiters. In addition, the following characters act as delimiters:</p>

<p>     (  )  ;  "  '  `  |</p>
<p>Finally, these next characters act as delimiters, despite the fact that Scheme does not define any special meaning for them:</p>

<p>     [  ]  {  }</p>
<p>For example, if the value of the variable name is "max":</p>

<p>     (list"Hi"name(+ 1 2))                   =>  ("Hi" "max" 3)</p>
<h1>1.3.3 Identifiers</h1>
<p>An identifier is a sequence of one or more non-delimiter characters. Identifiers are used in several ways in Scheme programs:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An identifier can be used as a variable or as a syntactic keyword.</li>
	<li>When an identifier appears as a literal or within a literal, it denotes a symbol.</li>
</ul>

<p>Scheme accepts most of the identifiers that other programming languages allow. MIT/GNU Scheme allows all of the identifiers that standard Scheme does, plus many more.</p>
<p>MIT/GNU Scheme defines a potential identifier to be a sequence of non-delimiter characters that does not begin with either of the characters `#' or `,'. Any such sequence of characters that is not a syntactically valid number (see Numbers) is considered to be a valid identifier. Note that, although it is legal for `#' and `,' to appear in an identifier (other than in the first character position), it is poor programming practice.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of identifiers:</p>
<code> lambda             q</code><br>
<code>    list->vector       soup</code><br>

<code>    +                  V17a</code><br>

<code>    <=?                a34kTMNs</code><br>

<code>    the-word-recursion-has-many-meanings</code>
